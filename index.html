            <h3>Aspiring software developer</h3>

            <p>I've always loved riddles and puzzles. When I was a kid, I often asked my mum to read me exercises that required logical thinking instead of fairy tales before going to bed.</p>
            <p>I just started my studies at Green Fox Academy in the company of 19 amazing students and I'm looking forward to how all this is going to go.</p>
